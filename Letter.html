<h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>

<p>Dear Eileen,</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<h3>Starting dates</h3>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10³ increasing to 3 × 10⁴.)</li>
    <li>HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, and CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. My favorite dances are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Polynesian chicken dance</strong>: A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BCE, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</li>
    <li><strong>Icelandic brownian shuffle</strong>: Before the Icelanders developed fire, they practiced this dance huddling close together on the floor, shuffling in tiny rapid movements. It may have inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</li>
    <li><strong>Arctic robot dance</strong>: English explorers in the 1960s thought they discovered a new robotic dance style in Northern Alaska and Canada, but it was actually due to extreme cold.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>
